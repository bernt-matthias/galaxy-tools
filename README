galaxy-tools
============

Tools and tool-wrappers for Galaxy.

Tools are organised into subdirectories; to add these to your local
Galaxy:

1. Either:
   Copy the subdirectory into your .../galaxy-dist/tools/ directory
   or:
   Make a soft link in .../galaxy-dist/tools/ to the tool subdirectory
   
2. Add an entry for the tool in .../galaxy-dist/tool_conf.xml

You will also need to restart Galaxy for the changes to take effect.

(Note that tests are available for each tool, but the test data is not
currently in this repository.)

fastq_screen
------------
XML and wrapper script for fastq_screen program. Assumes that
fastq_screen program is on the Galaxy user's path, and that
fastq_screen.conf has been configured appropriately for the local
setup.

To add to Galaxy put this somewhere in tool_conf.xml:
<tool file="fastq_screen/fastq_screen.xml" />

qc_boxplotter
-------------
XML and wrapper script for the FLS SOLiD QC boxplotter. Assumes that
colour_QC_script.sh (the driver for the boxplotter) is on the Galaxy
user's path (currently it's in
bioinf-scripts/NGS-general/qc_boxplotter/).

To add to Galaxy put this somewhere in tool_conf.xml:
<tool file="qc_boxplotter/qc_boxplotter.xml" />
