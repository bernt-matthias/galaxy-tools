Run RnaChipIntegrator to perform integrated analyses of gene expression
and ChIP data, identifying the nearest ChIP peaks to each transcript
and vice versa.

The program was originally written specifically for ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq data
but works equally well for ChIP-chip and microarray expression data, and can
also be used to integrate any set of genomic features (e.g. canonical genes,
CpG islands) with expression data.

The expression data must be in a tab-delimited file with the following columns
of data for each genomic feature (one feature per line):

    ID  chr  start  end  strand  [diff_expr]

`chr` is the chromosome name, `start` and `end` define the limits of the feature,
and strand must be either `+` or `-`. `ID` is a name which is used to identify the
genomic feature in the output. The 6th column `diff_expr` is optional, if present
then it indicates whether the transcript was differentially expressed (= 1) or not
(= 0).

The ChIP-seq data must be in a tab-delimited file with 3 columns of data for each
ChIP peak (one per line):

    chr  start  end

`chr` is the chromosome name (must match those in the RNA-seq file), and `start`
and `end` define the ChIP peaks - these can either be the summit of the binding
region (in which case 'end' - 'start' = 1), or the entire binding region (with
'start' and 'end' indicating the extent).
