**What it does**

This tool will find all matches to a DNA pattern in the input DNA sequence, represented by an IUPAC string. The matches are non-overlapping, so searching with 'TTTT' in 'TTTTTTTT' will find two hits to the IUPAC. The output is a table that gives the seqname and the number of matches to the IUPAC per sequence.  This version is useful if you want to get a count of IUPAC matches per sequence (e.g. a binding region) and paste the numbers back into a spreadsheet.

IUPAC = Nucleotide(s):

A = A
 
C = C

G = G

T = T

M = A/C

R = A/G

W = A/T

S = C/G

Y = C/T

K = G/T

V = A/C/G

H = A/C/T

D = A/G/T

B = C/G/T

N = A/C/G/T

**Options**

'IUPAC string' - can be entered as upper- or lower-case as the tool will force them to become upper-case, but will only accept the IUPAC codes listed above.

'Select sequence strands to scan' - Only scanning the forward strand if the input sequence is useful if the IUPAC is a palindrome (e.g. CANNTG).
