**What it does**

CEAS (Cis-regulatory Element Annotation System) is a tool for characterizing genome-wide
protein-DNA interaction patterns from ChIP-chip and ChIP-Seq of both sharp and broad
binding factors. It provides statistics on ChIP enrichment at important genome features
such as specific chromosome, promoters, gene bodies, or exons, and infers genes most
likely to be regulated by a binding factor.

CEAS also enables biologists to visualize the average ChIP enrichment signals over
specific genomic features, allowing continuous and broad ChIP enrichment to be perceived
which might be too subtle to detect from ChIP peaks alone.

This tool is compatible with CEAS 1.0.2. CEAS can be obtained from
