**What it does**

BLAT (BLAST-like Alignment Tool) is a tool which performs rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species
protein alignments. BLAT is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools
for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings
typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences.

Documentation for BLAT can be found here http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/blatSpec.html

**Credits**

This Galaxy tool has been developed within the Bioinformatics Core Facility at the
University of Manchester. It runs the BLAT tool developed by Jim Kent (Kent, W.J. 2002. BLAT --
The BLAST-Like Alignment Tool. Genome Research 4: 656-664). Information about obtaining
BLAT can be found at http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQblat.html#blat3

Please kindly acknowledge both this Galaxy tool and the BLAT program if you use it in
your work.
